=== Feature Attributes

*1. Surface Current Speed (_surfaceCurrentSpeed_)*

[cols="a",options="unnumbered,noheader"]
|===
| *Surface Current Speed:* Rate of motion. The terms speed and velocity
are often used interchangeably, but speed is a scalar, having magnitude
only, while velocity is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and
direction. Speed may either be the ship's speed through water, or
the speed made good over ground.

[underline]#Unit:# knot (kn)

[underline]#Maximum Resolution:# stem:[0.01 "unitsml(kn)"]

[underline]#Format:# xxx.xx

[example]
*2.54*

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Valid speed always non-negative.
* Negative number denotes land mask or missing value.
* stem:[0.01 "unitsml(kn)"] equals stem:[0.5144 "unitsml(cm/s)"].
* Must be populated with a non-fill value if _surfaceCurrentDirection_
is populated with a non-fill value at the same point.

|===

*2. Surface Current Direction (_surfaceCurrentDirection_)*

[cols="a",options="unnumbered"]
|===
| *Surface Current Direction:* The direction toward which a surface
current is flowing, called the set of the surface current.

[underline]#Unit:# degree (˚)

[underline]#Maximum Resolution:# 0.1 ˚

[underline]#Format:# xxx.x

[example]
*298.3*

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Direction clockwise from true north.
* Valid direction always non-negative.
* Negative number denotes land mask or missing value.
* Must be populated with a non-fill value if _surfaceCurrentSpeed_
is populated with a non-fill value at the same point

|===

*3. Surface Current Time (_surfaceCurrentTime_)*

[cols="a",options="unnumbered"]
|===
| *Surface Current Time:* The time of the surface current data, expressed
in <<ISO_8601_2004>> Date-time format.

[underline]#Unit:# Years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds

[underline]#Resolution:# 1 second

[underline]#Format:# YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, where Y is year, M is month,
D is day, H is hour, M is minute, and S is second

[example]
*19850412T101530Z* denotes 10 hours, 15 minutes, and 30 seconds, Universal
Time on 12 April 1985.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Required only for fixed station (stationwise) time series data
(_dataCodingFormat_ = 8) with non-uniform time intervals and moving
platform time series (_dataCodingFormat_ = 4) with non-uniform time
intervals.
* All times are in UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).

|===

*4. Direction Uncertainty (_directionUncertainty_)*

[cols="a",options="unnumbered"]
|===
| *Direction Uncertainty:* The best estimate of the accuracy of a
bearing.

[underline]#Unit:# degree (˚)

[underline]#Maximum Resolution:# 0.1 ˚

[underline]#Format:# xx.x

[example]
*10.0* for an uncertainty of 10 degrees.

[underline]#Remarks:# No remarks

|===

*5. Speed Uncertainty (_speedUncertainty_)*

[cols="a",options="unnumbered"]
|===
| *Speed Uncertainty:* Estimate characterising the accuracy of a speed
value, or of the magnitude component of a velocity.

[underline]#Unit:# knot (kn)

[underline]#Maximum Resolution:# 0.01 knots

[underline]#Format:# xx.xx

[example]
*0.3* for an uncertainty of ± 0.3 knots.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The estimate is as defined within a particular confidence level
and expressed as a positive value.
