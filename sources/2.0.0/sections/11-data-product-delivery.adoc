== Data Product Delivery

[[sec_11.1]]
=== Introduction

This clause describes how the Surface Current Data Product is to be
delivered from the Producer to the end user (that is navigation officer,
route planner, etc.).

Method of transfer will be primarily web-based, including ftp, although
some products (astronomical predictions) may be delivered via storage
media. The data will be supplied either directly from the Producer
or through a third party supplier.

Due to the cost of transmitting data via the internet, it is desirable
to limit file size and updating frequency whenever possible. Considerations
here are the size of each transfer as well as the total volume of
data transferred over time (the latter particularly applies to datasets
which are issued daily or more frequently, such as forecasts). The
following recommendations are therefore proposed:

. Each exchange data file, as created by the Producer and after compression,
is recommended to be limited to stem:[10 "unitsml(Mbyte_B)"].

. The "cell scheming" (geographic extents covered) for datasets, especially
datasets which are issued frequently (for example, daily or more frequent
forecasts) should be determined so as to reduce the transfer of unnecessary
data (information not needed for route planning or monitoring within
reasonable time windows). It is recommended that cell scheming and
grid density take into account the navigation purposes defined in
S100_NavigationPurpose, reproduced below:
.. port - For port and near shore operations
.. transit - For coast and planning purposes
.. overview - For ocean crossing and planning purposes

<<S_100,part=15,clause=15-5.2>> allows one data compression scheme:
Zip (note that this may not provide a significant reduction due to
internal compression applied within the HDF file). In addition, the
file may be encrypted.

Updating of files typically means issuing a new forecast, or disseminating
the latest observed current data for a specific geographic region.
This may occur several times per day. Therefore, all files must contain
a date-time of issuance of the product. Because of the potentially
high frequency (that is, hourly or less) availability of new datasets,
the ECDIS system may need to check for new data at a similar frequency.
The "resource maintenance" information in external metadata and "delivery
interval" in internal metadata should therefore be populated whenever
possible.

[[sec_11.2]]
=== HDF5 Dataset Packaging

The HDF5-formatted datasets are packaged with metadata and an Exchange
Catalogue, and then combined into an Exchange Set. HDF5 files for
time series or gridded current data may require internet transmission,
since they change several or more times a day.

[[sec_11.2.1]]
==== Exchange Sets

Exchange Sets produced by the Producer consist of files containing
an XML Exchange Catalogue, the HDF5 data products, and auxiliary files
(<<fig_11-1>>). The auxiliary files include an XML Feature Catalogue,
an XML Portrayal Catalogue, SVG files, and additional supporting XML
files for alarms and indications, and for interoperability.

The data products include one or more data sets (but of the same <<S_100>>
Product Specification types), with each product covering a specific
geographic region and specific period of time. The Exchange Catalogue
lists the products and contains the discovery metadata.

Since the transfer of large amounts of data may pose a problem for
recipients with limited network bandwidth, it is suggested that the
maximum size of exchange sets be approximately 10MB. This suggested
limit may be varied up or down depending on transfer channel capabilities
and constraints on producers, distributors, aggregators, and recipients.

The size of datasets (HDF5 data files) can vary widely, depending
on the data. Exchange files may be compressed using the DEFLATE compression
algorithm commonly used in ZIP archives (cf. <<S_100,part=15,clause=15-5.2>>).
Doing so can reduce file size by 80% or more.

[[sec_11.2.1.1]]
===== Exchange Set structure

The structure of an S-111 Exchange Set must be according to the structure
described below, which is based on <<S_100,part=17,clause=17-4.2>>.
The S-111 Exchange Set structure is depicted in <<fig_11-2>>.

. All content must be placed inside a top root folder named S100_ROOT.
This is the only top level root folder in an Exchange Set containing
only <<S_100>> products.

. The S100_ROOT folder must contain a subfolder for S-111 which holds
content specific to S-111.

. An S-111 Exchange Set must contain an Exchange Set Catalogue, CATALOG.XML,
its digital signature CATALOG.SIGN and may contain any number of S-111
conformant dataset files and Catalogue files.
. The S-111 subfolder must contain subfolders for the component dataset
files (DATASET_FILES) and Catalogues (CATALOGUES) as required:
.. The DATASET_FILES subfolder is required if and only if the Exchange
Set contains an S-111 HDF5 dataset.
.. The CATALOGUES subfolder is required if and only if the Exchange
Set contains a Feature or Portrayal Catalogue. (This Edition of S-111
does not include Interoperability Catalogues, which are described
by <<S_98>> and will be part of the exchange set structure described
in that specification.)

. The DATASET_FILES folder must contain a subfolder named according
to the Producer Code.
. Individual data files must be placed under the Producer subfolder,
either directly in the Producer folder, or within a lower-level subfolder
hierarchy. Individual data files may be optionally placed in their
own subfolders or grouped with other data files.
. An Exchange Set may carry Feature and Portrayal Catalogues in different
versions, which should also be grouped together in the CATALOGUES
folder.
. If a Portrayal Catalogue is included in the Exchange Set, it should
be packaged as either a ZIP archive containing all Portrayal Catalogue
files, or a filesystem structure of folders and files. The structure
of Portrayal Catalogues is described in <<S_100,part=9,clause=9-13.2>>
and guidance on packaging Portrayal Catalogues is provided in <<sec_9.9>>.
. Except for the signature of the Exchange Catalogue file (CATALOG.XML),
which is in the CATALOG.SIGN file, all digital signatures are included
within their corresponding resource metadata records in CATALOG.XML.
. Dataset and Catalogue file and/or folder names should be such as
to avoid inadvertent overwriting of files.
. Digital signatures are required for Exchange Sets and datasets intended
for navigation on ECDIS. All resources included within an Exchange
Set intended for navigation, including support files and catalogues,
must be signed (<<S_100,part=17>>).
. It is not necessary for an Exchange Set to contain more than one
build of a Feature or Portrayal Catalogue for the same version of
a Product Specification. For example, an Exchange Set will not contain
both 111_2_0_0_FC/20210630/ and 111_2_0_0_FC/20220101/ folders for
Edition 2.0.0 Feature Catalogues. The presence of both in <<fig_11-2>>
is only for illustrative purposes.
. Inclusion of the dictionary of enumerations in any particular Exchange
Set is optional, since it will be the same for all datasets from all
producers. For similar reasons, inclusion of the Feature Catalogue
and Portrayal Catalogue in any particular Exchange Set is optional.
Producers may distribute dummy Exchange Sets containing only the Feature
Catalogue, Portrayal Catalogue, and enumerations dictionary, when
any of them is updated or when a new version of the Product Specification
is released. Validation checks should ensure that these files are
present on the system if they are not included in any particular Exchange
Set.

[[fig_11-2]]

General guidelines for Exchange Set structure are included in <<S_100,part=17>>.

Note that the names and locations of files are coded within the CATALOG.XML
or Portrayal Catalogue files, and therefore files and folders should
not be renamed or relocated by Producers or end-user systems unless
these references can be updated. Portrayal and Feature Catalogues
can be relocated to a common system location if their internal structure
is maintained.

[[sec_11.2.2]]
==== Exchange Catalogue

The Exchange Catalogue which is in XML format acts as the table of
contents for the Exchange Set. The catalogue file of the Exchange
Set must be named CATALOG.XML (as specified in <<S_100,part=17>>);
no other file in the Exchange Set may have the same name. The contents
of the Exchange Catalogue are described in <<sec_12>>.

The Exchange Catalogue Schemas for S-111 are the same as for <<S_100>>
and may be obtained from the IHO S-100 Schema server: https://schemas.s100dev.net.
The S-111 Exchange Catalogue uses an additional product-specific constraints file
implementing product-specific restrictions, which is also available from the
same site. Use of the additional product-specific constraints file is optional;
developers may implement the constraints using any convenient method.

[[sec_11.2.3]]
==== Dataset file naming

The dataset file contains both metadata and one or more sets of speed
and direction arrays (see <<sec_10,style=full%>>). The dataset name
must begin with the three-character Product Specification, followed
by the four-character Producer Code (CCCC) footnote:[Producer Codes
may be obtained from the IHO Producer Code Register in the IHO GI
Registry. The four-character S-100 "Alpha" codes must be used.]. Thus
surface current datasets begin with the seven-character string '111CCCC'.

The characters between this string and the extension are nominally
unrestricted in <<S_100>> and <<S_97>> Edition 1.1.0. However, S-111
restricts the "unrestricted" characters as follows:

* Alphabetic characters in the "Latin alphabet"; that is, A-Z and
a-z;
* Numeric characters; that is, the characters 0-9;
* The hyphen and underscore characters ("-" and "_").

The unrestricted characters may be used to denote geographical region,
valid time, source of the data, version numbers, and/or any other
relevant information. Characters may be lower or upper case
footnote:[Exceptions: (1) Producer Codes must use the same case as
the IHO Producer Code Register. (2) A name component taken from an
external Specification, must follow the rules in that Specification
(for example, "20190703T00Z" for a time component in <<ISO_8601_2004>>
basic format, not "20190703t00z").]. For real-time and forecast data,
it is recommended that the dateTime of the first record be part of
the dataset name, to help distinguish the most recent files.

The filename extension for HDF5 (.h5) must be used to denote the file
format.

The total length of the file name shall be no more than 64 characters,
including the extension.

[example]
111US00_CHES_TYPE1_20210630_0600.HDF5 for observational data
(see <<sec_12.3.5>>, <<table_12-10>>) produced by NOAA for Chesapeake
Bay (CHES), observations beginning from 06:00 UTC on 30 June 2021.

[example]
111US00_ches_dcf8_20190703T00Z.h5 for a dataset produced by NOAA containing
data for NOAA fixed stations in the Chesapeake Bay (ches) organised
stationwise (dcf8) beginning from midnight at the beginning of 3 July
2019.

Each producer should adopt a naming scheme that is consistent across
its entire S-111 product line. While the examples above are hypothetical,
they illustrate how the principles of this clause can be applied by
Producers.

[[sec_11.2.3.1]]
===== Dataset MRN (Informative)

The dataset file name may be mapped to an MRN as follows:

urn:mrn:iho:s111:<ver>:<cccc>:<region>:<type>:<dtg>

where:

* The first part "urn:mrn:iho:s111" is common to all dataset URNs
for S-111;
* The product specification version is represented by the "<ver>"
part, for example, "2:0:0" for Edition 2.0.0;
* <cccc> represents the 4-character Producer Code;
* <region> represents the geographical region;
* <type> represents the data coding format, for example "type2" for
regular grids;
* <dtg> represents the date/time component in the name.

This is an interim rule pending definition of an "S-100-wide" rule
for MRNs and will be superseded by the "S-100-wide" rule when it is
published.

[[sec_11.2.4]]
==== Support Files

Only the following types of support files are allowed in S-111:

* Optional 'language packs' for Feature Catalogues. Each language
pack contains a translation of the Feature Catalogue into a specified
language.
* Dictionary resource files listing the allowed values and codes of
enumerations. There will generally be a single dictionary file for
each version of the Product Specification (corrections, if any, will
be issued through the usual mechanism for corrections). Inclusion
of the dictionary resource file in Exchange Sets is optional, since
the Internet location is standardised and manufacturers are permitted
to obtain it by other means and install it in an application-specific
location.

[[sec_11.2.5]]
==== Support File Naming

[[sec_11.2.5.1]]
===== General

Support file names are subject to the same naming rules as dataset
file names (<<sec_11.2.3>>), except that the extension is determined
by the support file format.

This clause covers names of language packs and enumeration dictionaries,
which are the only support files allowed in this Edition of S-111.
Producers who discover a need for other types of support files should
conform to the general rule above and consult TWCWG as necessary.

[[sec_11.2.5.2]]
===== Names of language packs

If a language pack created by a data Producer for the S-111 Feature
Catalogue is included, it must have the standard 7-character "111CCCC"
prefix and the same base name as the standard IHO-issued Feature Catalogue
with the 3-letter ISO 639-2/T language code suffixed. The language
codes must be exactly those in the S-100 codelist for languages
(*S100_MD_LanguageCode*, which can be found in the S-100 Schema distribution).
The file extension must be ".XML".

NOTE: A language pack issued by the IHO for the IHO Feature Catalogue
will use the IHO Producer Code.

[[sec_11.2.5.3]]
===== Names of enumeration dictionaries

Enumeration dictionaries are supplied by IHO as part of this Product
Specification and should not be renamed.

NOTE: (informative): Substitute or extended enumeration dictionaries
may be developed if translations are needed. Producers who desire
to provide translations of enumeration dictionaries with S-111 Exchange
Sets should consult with TWCWG.
