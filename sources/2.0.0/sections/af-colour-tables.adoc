== Colour Tables (Informative)

Below are typical colour tables for the day, dusk, and night conditions
(<<table_F-1;and!table_F-2;and!table_F-3>>). The estimates for dusk
and night were obtained by first converting the values for RGB colours
for day conditions (see <<sec_9.2.3>>) to stem:[xyL] values, where
stem:[L] is luminance. The conversion assumes the colours are the
standard RGB (sRGB) and the calculations follow the explanation in
IEC 61966 (<<IEC_61966_2_1_1999>> -- _Multimedia systems and equipment
- Colour measurement and management - Part 2-1: Colour management
- Default RGB colour space - sRGB_). Note that in S-52 colours, the
conversion from stem:[xyY] to stem:[xyL] requires that stem:[L = 100Y].

Existing stem:[xyL] data for dusk and night conditions for approximately
50 S-52 colours (_S-52 Presentation Library Edition 4.0.0, Part 1,
Appx. A_) demonstrate that for the lower light conditions luminance
is reduced while the x and y values remain approximately constant.
Here, for each S-111 colour, the closest (that is, smallest root mean
square of the sum of the squares of the difference in x values and
y values) S-52 colour for day conditions was identified, and that
colour's luminance reduction factors for the other light conditions
were used to calculate the new S-111 stem:[xyL] values. Finally, the
new stem:[xyL] values were converted to RGB values and their hexadecimal
equivalents.

NOTE: The contents of this Annex are "as of publication" and may be
revised for usability and interoperability based on user testing and
ECDIS requirements in <<S_98>> and applicable IMO/IEC standards. The
content of the S-111 Portrayal Catalogue should prevail in case of
conflict between the latest formal release of the Portrayal Catalogue
and the contents of this Annex.
