== Metadata

[[sec_12.1]]
=== Introduction

For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata
required:

* Metadata about the overall Exchange Dataset and Catalogue;
* Discovery metadata about each of the datasets contained in the Catalogue;
and
* Discovery metadata about the support files that make up the package.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable
important information about the datasets and accompanying support
files to be examined without the need to process the data, for example
decrypt, decompress, load etc.

Catalogues (Feature and Portrayal Catalogues) can be included in the
Exchange Set in support of the datasets. If included, discovery metadata
about the Catalogues must also be provided.

NOTE: S-111 datasets do not reference support files. The only support
files allowed in the Exchange Set are "language packs" for Feature
Catalogues and enumeration dictionaries, and these are not referenced
from within the HDF5 datasets.

Discovery metadata for each HDF5 dataset is given in an XML block
within the Exchange Set Catalogue file, and can be accessed without
opening the HDF5 file. In addition to discovery metadata, S-111 also
provides for carrier metadata that is embedded within the HDF5 file,
which provides information needed to process and display the data.
Discovery metadata is described in <<sec_12.2>>; carrier metadata
in <<sec_12.3>>.

This clause defines the mandatory and optional metadata needed for
S-111. In some cases (if provided by the Producer or Exchange Set
packager) the metadata may be repeated in a language other than English.
See <<S_100,part=17>>, clauses 17-4.6 -- 17-4.8 for guidance on encoding
of metadata in languages other than English.

==== Realisation of Exchange Set components and metadata classes (informative)

The realization of S-111 Exchange Set components and metadata classes
from <<ISO_19115_1>> and <<ISO_19115_3>> is the same as in <<S_100,part=17>>,
depicted in <<fig_12-1>>.

The Figure depicts, from left to right:

. The relevant ISO data exchange structural classes;
. The relevant ISO metadata classes for metadata for exchange;
. <<S_100>> structure classes representing the S-100/S-111 exchange
set components;
. The relevant S-100/S-111 Exchange Set metadata classes.

Note that the only support files in S-111 are language packs or enumeration
dictionaries, represented by *S100_SupportFile*. The corresponding
metadata blocks are represented by *S100_SupportFileDiscoveryMetadata*
elements.

==== Exchange Set components and related metadata

<<fig_12-2>> depicts the relationships of Exchange Set "core" elements
(datasets and Feature/Portrayal Catalogues) and Exchange Set metadata.
This Figure is derived from <<S_100,part=17,figure=17-2>>. Relationships
not applicable to S-111 have been omitted (for example, the link between
datasets and support files in <<S_100,figure=17-2>>, because S-111
datasets do not reference support files). Note also that the link
between *S100_Dataset* and *S100_CatalogueMetadata* is implicit by
means of the S-111 version to which the Feature Catalogue, Portrayal
Catalogue and dataset conform, which must have the same Edition and
revision components.

[[fig_12-2]]
.Components and associated metadata for the S-111 Exchange Set (<<S_100,part=17,figure=17-2>> with relationships not used by S-111 omitted)
image::figure-12-2.png[]

The rules governing the presence and roles of the exchange set components
depicted in <<fig_12-2>> are given below.

. Every exchange set must contain an Exchange Catalogue, represented
by *S100_ExchangeCatalogue* in <<fig_12-2>>.
. Dataset discovery metadata (*S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata*) must
be provided in the exchange catalogue for each S-111 dataset in the
exchange set.
. Catalogue metadata (*S100_CatalogueDiscoveryMetadata*) must be provided
in the exchange catalogue for any feature and portrayal catalogues
included in the exchange set.
. The only support files allowed are language packs and enumeration
dictionaries (both represented by *S100_SupportFile*). Their inclusion
in exchange sets is optional.
. Producers must not include ISO metadata files to convey information
for ECDIS application processing, since processing these files is
not an ECDIS requirement. All information necessary for ECDIS processing
must be in CATALOG.XML.
. Language packs are described in <<S_100,part=18>> and provide translations
of feature catalogues.
. If a language pack is included, a support file discovery metadata
block (*S100_SupportFileDiscoveryMetadata*) describing the file must
be included in the exchange catalogue.
. A signature file for the Exchange Catalogue must also be included
in the Exchange Set footnote:[Temporarily suspended; <<S_97>> 1.1.0
states digital signatures are essential only for technical readiness
level 3.] (*S100_CatalogueSignature*).

Since S-111 does not add product-specific metadata attributes, the
<<S_100>> metadata classes and Schema are used in S-111 Exchange Sets
without extension. The constraints S-111 impose on generic <<S_100>>
metadata are described in the documentation tables in <<sec_12.2>>.

NOTE: The distribution package implements the additional S-111 constraints
on metadata attributes (and many of the <<S_100>> constraints) as
Schematron rules in files available from the IHO Schema server. Implementers
may substitute any implementation method to apply or check constraints
instead of using Schematron-capable processing software.

The tangible representations of the structure classes in <<fig_12-2>>
within actual Exchange Sets are the digital files or folders containing
the Exchange Set, dataset(s), Catalogue(s), and support files. The
tangible representations of their roles as depicted in <<fig_12-2>>
are the inclusion of the respective components within the Exchange
Set. Documentation tables for the structure classes are not provided
since the Exchange Set structure is described in <<sec_11.2.1>>.

The metadata classes in <<fig_12-2>> are represented by XML files
or XML blocks and are documented in <<sec_12.2>>.

=== Discovery metadata

An outline of the overall concept of an S-111 Exchange Set for the
interchange of geospatial data and its relevant metadata is explained
in <<sec_11.2.1;and!sec_12.1>>. The place of metadata in the Exchange
Set is summarised in <<sec_12.1.2>>.

<<fig_12-3>> depicts the structure of the Exchange Catalogue and its
component discovery metadata blocks. The structure is the same as
in <<S_100,part=17>>.

[[fig_12-3]]
.Relationship between Exchange Catalogue, discovery metadata, and dataset (from <<S_100,part=17,figure=17-6>>)
image::figure-12-3.png[]

The detailed structure of the S-111 Exchange Catalogue is depicted
in <<fig_12-4>>. This Figure is derived from <<S_100,part=17,figure=17-7>>,
with the following restrictions:

* Elements that are optional in the generic S-100 catalogue model
but not used in S-111 are not shown; for example, the _updateNumber_
and _updateApplicationDate_ attributes in the dataset discovery class
are not used in S-111.
* Constraints that are specific to S-111 are summarised in a diagram
note. Details about constraints are provided in the documentation
tables following the diagram.

In S-111 Edition 2.0.0 only Feature and Portrayal Catalogues are allowed.

The language used for the metadata is English.

Time reference for all data will be UTC.

*All depth or height values to be given in metres (up to two decimal places for real values).*

More detailed information about the various classes and textual descriptions
of the constraints are in the Tables in <<sec_12.2.1;to!sec_12.2.30>>
following <<fig_12-4>>. Differences from generic S-100 metadata are
emphasized for developer convenience in *bold* text.

NOTE: If there are multiple grid or TIN features in the dataset, each
feature should have a separate _dataCoverage_ attribute in dataset
discovery metadata, except that the coverages for intersecting or
adjacent features with the same grid resolution may be combined at
producer discretion.

NOTE: Bounding polygons for grid features should be the same as the
spatial extent of the grid.

NOTE: Bounding polygons for TIN features may either be the union of
all triangles defined in the TIN, or the bounding box covering all
the vertexes of the TIN.

NOTE: Bounding polygons for multipoint features (DCF 1 and 8) may
be one or more reasonably minimized polygons or bounding boxes that
together cover all data points.

NOTE: A boundingPolygon is restricted to a single GML Polygon with
one exterior and 0 or more interiors expressed as Linear Rings using
SRS EPSG:4326. The exterior and optional interiors shall be composed
of a closed sequence of >=4 coordinate positions expressed individually
or as a list (posList). The GML polygon shall have a valid GML identifier

NOTE: For _approximateGridResolution_, if the grid cell size varies
over the extent of the grid, an approximated value based on model
parameters or production metadata should be used.

=== Carrier metadata

The metadata for the S-111 product is divided in three sections, corresponding
to the General Metadata (<<table_12-1>>), the Feature Type Metadata
(<<table_12-2>>), and the Feature Instance Metadata (<<table_12-3>>
and <<table_12-4>>). The Instance Metadata is subdivided into metadata
attached to the instance as a whole (<<table_12-3>>) and metadata
attached to individual values groups (<<table_12-4>>). Since these
values do not reside in the Metadata blocks, but are in the HDF files,
they are referred to as Carrier Metadata. The Carrier Metadata consists
of the data and parameters needed to read and interpret the information
in the Surface Current product even if the other S-111 Metadata files
are unavailable.

Note that in <<table_12-1;to!table_12-4>>, some of the metadata variables
have restrictions on their core values (that is, whether they are
optional or mandatory, the specific values allowed, etc) that are
not imposed in <<S_100>>. These are grouped under the heading
'_Metadata for S-111 with restrictions on core metadata values_.'

Mandatory attributes in a section of a Table that is designated for
one or more specified _dataCodingFormat_ values are mandatory only
for the specified _dataCodingFormat_ value(s).

It is suggested for any enumeration in S-111, to use unsigned integer
types (preferably standard integer type H5T_STD_U8LE) for the base
type of the numeric code when creating the enumeration footnote:[See
the guidance on HDF5 datatypes
(https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/datatypes.html, retrieved
20 August 2021) for more information on the use of standard vs native
types when creating a dataset and for memory operations (read/write).].

<<fig_12-5;to!fig_12-9>> depict the carrier metadata at each level of
the structural hierarchy in an HDF5 dataset. The elements (groups
and metadata) defined in <<S_100>> are distinguished from those defined
in S-111 by prefix and shade. <<fig_12-5>> is a summary diagram depicting
all levels of the structural and their associated metadata components
for all the coverage types used in S-111. <<fig_12-6;to!fig_12-9>>
show the details for each structural level and each coverage type.

The same information as in <<fig_12-6;to!fig_12-9>> is depicted in
<<annex-b>> (<<fig_B-6;to!fig_B-10>>) but organised by type of coverage
instead of levels in the HDF5 structural hierarchy.

The maximum length of all string HDF5 attributes is 300 characters.

For all carrier metadata, latitude and longitude values are precise
to stem:[10^{-7}] degrees except where noted. All times are in UTC
format.

All enumeration attributes in carrier metadata must be implemented
as HDF5 enumerations. The base type for all enumeration attributes
in the following tables must be 8-bit unsigned integer in the HDF5
standard integer type H5T_STD_U8LE.

Integer types are signed integers unless designated as "unsigned".

Strings must use UTF-8 character encoding. String padding is not specified
in this edition of the Product Specification due to the diversity
of API framework treatment of padding.

[NOTE]
====
If the CRS is user defined only the following coordinate systems are
supported:

. Geodetic CS (Latitude, Longitude) -- Degrees; and
. Cartesian CS (Northing, Easting or Easting, Northing) -- Metres.
====

NOTE: For the horizontal Datum all EPSG predefined Datums are allowed
or any combination of predefined Prime Meridians or predefined Spheroids.

NOTE: The projection methods are limited to those given in <<table_12-7>>.

NOTE: If the horizontal CRS is defined by the EPSG code, the defined
CRS should not use any other elements than the one allowed for user
defined CRSs; (for example, no projection method that is not in the
Table).

NOTE: The bounding box is the data set bounding box; the coverage
data feature instances may or may not cover the entire bounding box.
If there is only a single coverage feature, its extent may or may
not be the same as the data set.

NOTE: Beginning <<S_100>> Edition 5.0.0, class *S100_ProductSpecification*
(<<S_100,part=17>>) contains a _productIdentifier_ field whose value
must be the Product ID value from the IHO Product Specification Register
in the IHO Geospatial Information Registry. Attribute _productSpecification_
in <<table_12-1>> must use exactly the same value.

NOTE: Beginning <<S_100>> Edition 5.0.0, _seaSurface_ and _seaFloor_
have been added to the *S100_VerticalAndSoundingDatum* enumeration,
which makes attribute _verticalCoordinateBase_ redundant. It is included
in order to ensure compliance with generic validation checks for attribute
verticalDatum.

NOTE: Dataset delivery interval is encoded only if the dataset is
part of a sequence delivered at known intervals (for example, daily,
weekly, or 6-hourly forecasts). <<S_100,part=17,clause=17-4.9>> contains
detailed guidance for encoding the discovery metadata equivalent of
this attribute (_userDefinedMaintenancefrequency_) and the same guidelines
apply to encoding this attribute. If this attribute and its discovery
metadata equivalent are both encoded (in the HDF5 dataset and discovery
metadata block respectively), the durations encoded by them must be
the same. Intervals greater than monthly may be encoded at Producer
discretion.
