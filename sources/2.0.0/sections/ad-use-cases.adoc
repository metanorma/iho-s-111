h| Name: | Ecological Benefit of Route Planning with Surface Current Information(Courtesy HyunSoo Choi â€“ KRISO; KHOA)

h| Description:
| A ferry operator plies between locations subject to constraints
on departure and arrival times, route, and speed restrictions. There
is some flexibility as to the exact route travelled. S-111 Surface
Current time series information covering the time of the planned transit
is available to the operator. The ferry operator uses information
about surface currents to establish a sailing plan based on dynamic
waterway information, including determining a target speed for each
section of a planned route so as to optimise fuel consumption. Engine
speeds at different sections of the route are planned to take advantage
of current flow.

The optimal sailing plan allows the ferry to complete the transit
within acceptable parameters for time, speed restrictions, and routing,
while reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.

Current predictions may also be utilized to prepare sailing plans
that minimize vessel exposure to conditions which pose more demands
on equipment and more risk to vessel safety.

The main users are ferry operators, navigation officers, and pilots.

==== Additional details

Long-distance ferry routes between Mokpo and Jeju were selected to
evaluate the impact of tidal currents on ship operations. The route
is about 92 miles, which takes 4 hours and 30 minutes in general conditions.
The ferry is a 9,832-ton ship with 900 people on board.

A simulation explored two scenarios:

* Scenario 1 considers general operating patterns for legal routes
that actually operate.
* Scenario 2 optimizes RPM usage by section by taking into consideration
S-111 seawater flow.

Fuel consumption during different sections of the routes for the two
scenarios is compared in <<fig_D-1>> below.

Scenario 1 shows that fuel consumption is somewhat high because it
operates at a high speed of 23-24 knots after leaving the speed limit
area near Mokpo, and then approaches in time for entry by lowering
RPM consumption from near Jeju Port. Scenario 2 optimized the RPM
use plan by considering the flow of seawater in advance for each point
where the ship moves. In addition, ships were allowed to use seawater
flow near Jindo Island, where the maximum flow rate occurs.

* Normal Route Planning

** Uses only the changing time of falling and rising currents
** After departing from Mokpo, proceed at full speed and adjust speed
near Jeju
* Optimal Route Planning

** When establishing a sailing plan, the operator can check the predicted
currents (direction, current speed) on an hourly basis.
** After checking the dynamic waterway information for each time segment
provided by S-100 data products, set the target speed for each section
and arrive at Jeju.
* S-111 Surface Currents with 1hr interval

** During sailing, there will be RPM differences under the influence
of the flow.

==== Simulation Results

The amount of fuel consumed for 4 hours and 30 minutes was analysed
using the engine RPM log and fuel consumption rate used in the simulation.
The fuel required 13.02 tons and 11.12 tons, respectively, which reduced
fuel consumption by 14.6% when the ship was operated after establishing
an optimized routing plan in consideration of S-111 seawater flow.
Although the arrival time and average speed were almost the same,
it can be seen that the route plan reflecting S-111 surface currents
and considering Just-in-time is much more economical.

As fuel consumption was reduced by about 14.6%, the emission of pollutants
such as carbon and nitrogen oxides was also reduced to a similar percentage.

==== Data

The range of S-111 data generated by KHOA's physical prediction model
is 72 hours. Surface currents grids are stem:[300 "unitsml(m)"]
stem:[2 "unitsml(km)"] and stem:[3 "unitsml(km)"], and stem:[2 "unitsml(km)"]
grids were used in this test.
